# Parsing Types Pro's and Con's

Top-down parsers and Pratt parsers are two different parsing techniques, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. When it comes to creating a functional programming language, your choice between these techniques depends on your language's grammar and your project's requirements. Let's explore the pros and cons of each:

**Top-Down Parsing:**

_Pros:_

1. **Predictable Structure:** Top-down parsers often use formal grammars like LL(k) or recursive descent parsers, which closely follow the structure of a BNF or EBNF grammar. This can make the parser's structure easier to understand and align with the language's grammar.

2. **Full Language Coverage:** Top-down parsers are more suited for complex, context-sensitive languages. You can use features like backtracking and semantic predicates to handle more intricate grammatical rules.

3. **Integrated Error Handling:** It's often easier to integrate error-handling mechanisms, such as producing meaningful error messages, in a top-down parser.

_Cons:_

1. **Complexity:** Depending on the language's grammar, the parser's code can become complex, especially for languages with context-sensitive or ambiguous grammar.

2. **Efficiency:** Recursive descent parsers can have issues with left-recursive rules and might need extra handling to avoid infinite recursion.

**Pratt Parsing:**

_Pros:_

1. **Simplicity:** Pratt parsing is simpler to implement and understand, particularly for languages with simple or nearly context-free grammars.

2. **Operator Precedence:** Pratt parsing is particularly well-suited for parsing expressions with different operator precedences, common in functional programming languages.

3. **Error Recovery:** Pratt parsing can provide good error recovery with its approach to parsing expressions.

_Cons:_

1. **Expression-Oriented:** Pratt parsing is primarily focused on parsing expressions and might not be the best choice for parsing the full syntax of a language, especially if the language's grammar is more complex.

2. **Limited Language Coverage:** Pratt parsing is best suited for languages where expressions are a significant portion of the syntax. Parsing other language constructs (statements, declarations, etc.) may require additional techniques.

In summary, the choice between top-down and Pratt parsing depends on the complexity of your functional programming language's grammar. If your language has a complex grammar with a mix of statements, expressions, and context-sensitive rules, a top-down parser may be more appropriate. If your language is primarily expression-oriented and has many different operator precedences, Pratt parsing can provide a more straightforward and efficient solution.

In some cases, a hybrid approach is also possible, where you use Pratt parsing for expressions and a top-down parser for the rest of the language. Ultimately, the best choice depends on your project's specific requirements and the nature of the language you're creating.
